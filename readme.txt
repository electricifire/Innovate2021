Converter management system connected to the cloud (COMASYC)
Project: AS009

Energy is a priority for humanity, in that sense, green energies are a necessity to satisfy the energy shortage and preserve the environment. So electronic converters play a key role. 
A converter management system connected to the cloud controlled by a FPGA is proposed for applications in industry 4.0. It has capabilities to integrate panels solar arrays (PVs), batteries, loads at the same time with different converters according to user requirements. That means that the proposed system manages modulation, algorithms, collect information, and distribute energy.
For example, if the user requires a PV, then the P&O MPPPT algorithm is implemented to obtain the maximum energy in the PVs. 
On the other hand, parameters such as energy consumption and production of each node are important for the redistribution of energy, for this reason, this model has a single brain that is connected to each node. So, a novel control is proposed based on load balancing managed by the cloud for high-priority requests. The cloud is the single brain that controls the system and organizes the flow power among nodes. The project is focused on the Peruvian reality for places where energy has to be a priority.
